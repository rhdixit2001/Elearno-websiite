                that are 100% virtual, excluding massively open online courses (MOOCs). Online learning, or virtual
                classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional courses taken in a brick-and-mortar
                school building. It is the newest development in distance education that began in the mid-1990s with the
                spread of the internet and the World Wide Web. Learner experience is typically asynchronous, but may
                also incorporate synchronous elements. The vast majority of institutions utilize a Learning Management
                System for the administration of online courses. As theories of distance education evolve, digital
                technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue to transform as well.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits.
                Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research.
                Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate
                themselves.
                Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect
                on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is
                called pedagogy.

                    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Given the improvements in delivery methods, online learning
                        environments provide a greater degree of flexibility than traditional classroom
                        settings.[16][17] Online platforms can also offer more diverse representations of student
                        populations as learners prepare for working in the twenty-first century.[18] The diversity comes
                        from interacting with students outside of one's geographical location, possibly offering a
                        variety of perspectives on course content.[18] Courses offered completely online are primarily
                        delivered in an asynchronous learning or synchronous learning format.
